Hi! I'm Tom Joshi-Cale, and I'm a second-year Astrophysics PhD student at the University of Exeter. My project is titled "Modelling the Angular Momentum and Heat Transport in Stellar Interiors" and focusses on using the Dedalus pseudo-spectral code to run HPC simulations of 2D, 2.5D and 3D convection and explore how it is affected by factors like rotation and angular momentum.

My primary coding language is Python, I have experience using the ISCA supercomputer, using the Dedalus Pseudo-spectral code, and I have also completed the [FreeCodeCamp.org Scientific Programming in Python](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/tomjoshi-cale/scientific-computing-with-python-v7), and the code I wrote for that course can be found [here](https://github.com/TomJoshi-Cale/FCC-Scientific-Python). I also used Python for my MPhys project investigating the long-term variability of Young Stellar Objects (some code from which can be found [here](https://github.com/TomJoshi-Cale/MPhys-YSO-Code)).

I am proficient at coding in C due to the Computational Modelling in C module at university, and my project submissions for that module can be found in [here](https://github.com/TomJoshi-Cale/PHYM004-CompMod). 

In my own time I am working through further FreeCodeCamp qualifications. I have completed the [Javascript qualification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/tomjoshi-cale/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) and am currently working on the Front End Development course.

I'm personally committed to Outreach, having spoken at the Plymouth Astronomical Society about the Sun, and assisted the Newton Abbot Beavers and Cubs get their "Space badge". I attended RASreach 2023 in Glasgow, and am looking forward to assisting with Robert Izzard's [Stars for Schools](http://personal.ph.surrey.ac.uk/~ri0005/stars_for_schools.html) project in the future.

I'm not just good behind a computer screen, I also have great communication, presentation and interpersonal skills - making me a great team worker who is also capable of stepping up into leadership roles where necessary.
